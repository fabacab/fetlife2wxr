# FetLife to WordPress eXtended RSS (WXR) Generator - ReadMe

The FetLife to WordPress eXtended RSS (WXR) Generator (`fetlife2wxr`) is a simple tool that creates a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) import file from a FetLife user account offering an easy way to import your [FetLife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FetLife) Writings to a WordPress blog, such as a free one hosted at [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/).

You can [try a demo](http://fetlife.maybemaimed.com/fetlife2wxr/) or install this on your own server to offer the tool to others who trust you. This code is offered freely, but please consider [making a donation](http://maybemaimed.com/cyberbusking/) if you found it useful.

## Getting started

Using `fetlife2wxr` mimics how one might [use a standard WordPress importer](http://en.support.wordpress.com/import/).

[Patches welcome](https://github.com/meitar/fetlife2wxr/issues/new).
