# FetLife to WordPress eXtended RSS (WXR) Generator - ReadMe

The FetLife to WordPress eXtended RSS (WXR) Generator (`fetlife2wxr`) is a simple tool that creates a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) export file from a [FetLife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FetLife) user account. In other words, it exports your FetLife content in a format that makes other computers believe you were blogging with WordPress rather than FetLife. That's really useful because it offers an easy way to import your FetLife Writings and Pictures to any WordPress blog, such as a free one hosted at [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/). It also makes things easier if you want to import your content from FetLife to a different blogging platform, because you can easily [convert a WordPress export file to another format, like a Blogger BlogSpot export file](http://wordpress2blogger.appspot.com/), too.

You can [try a demo](http://fetlife.maybemaimed.com/fetlife2wxr/) or install this on your own server to offer the tool to others who trust you. This code is offered freely, but please consider [making a donation](http://maybemaimed.com/cyberbusking/) if you found it useful.

## Getting started

Using `fetlife2wxr` mimics how one might [use a standard WordPress importer](http://en.support.wordpress.com/import/).
